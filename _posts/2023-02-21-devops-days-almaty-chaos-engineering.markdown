This is the recording from my speech on DevOpsDays Almaty 2022. I'm covering the following topics in the video:

* What is Chaos Engineering
* Main principles and history of chaos engineering
* How it's related to AWS Well Architected Framework
* What tools we can use for Chaos Engineering
* What is the best way to do it right now

Attention: The speech's language's Russian!
