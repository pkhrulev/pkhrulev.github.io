This is the recording from my speech on IT Talk Rostov-on-Don in 2021. I'm covering the following topics in the video:

* How multi-account environments are connected with migration to the cloud
* What are multi-account environments in AWS
* Why we may need multi-account approach
* What tools we can use to support multi-account structure

The speech's language's **Russian**!
